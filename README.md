# Spectrum
### Module for spectral data processing, analysis, treatment, and visualization.

Developed as a collaboration between J. Barrett, W. Galloway, and J. Wyzula.

The code for Kramers-Kronig analysis is heavily based on the program kktr.cpp by C.C. Homes, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The original code was developed for a C/C++ compiler and has been rewritten for a Python compiler.

The data used for the demos is the magneto-reflectivity for two facets of NbAs2 collected by J. Wyzula et al. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07266.

### Please refer to the following demos for using the module:

- dataAnalysis_demo describes using the spectrum module for data processing and treatment
- visualization_demo describes using the spectrum module to visualize data as false color plots and stacked plots.
- KK_demo describes using the spectrum module to conduct Kramers-Kronig analysis to obtain optical properties from the spectral data.
